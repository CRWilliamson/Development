CodeTest is a project that will require some building if you want to access everything through Unreal Engine. Alternatively, all cpp files can be accessed in CodeTest/Source and a full WindowsNoEditor build can be found in CodeTest/Saved/StagedBuilds.

To build the Visual Studio project solution, right click the CodeTest project executable and find "Generate Visual Studio project files"

It is recommended that you view the Unreal project and Solution using:
Unreal Engine 4.22.3
Visual Studio 2017

Thank you.
